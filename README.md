# 🏥 Hospital Resource Optimization Project

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing hospital resources—including staff, patients, and inventory—using Power BI. It aims to support better data-driven decision-making for different hospital stakeholders. This dashboard provides a high-level overview of hospital operations to support strategic decision-making. It integrates insights from patient flow, staff availability, and inventory usage to ensure optimal resource allocation across the hospital.

## 📊 Project Overview

Hospitals deal with large amounts of data across multiple departments. This project leverages three main datasets:
- **Patients**
- **Staff**
- **Supply Inventory**

The goal is to optimize resource allocation, improve patient care, and identify inefficiencies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify bottlenecks in hospital operations.
- Analyze patient admissions, wait times, and severity levels.
- Track staff shifts, absences, and department workloads.
- Monitor medical inventory usage and inventory levels.
- Build stakeholder-specific dashboards for targeted insights.
